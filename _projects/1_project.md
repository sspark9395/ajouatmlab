Cellular senescence is defined as an irreversible cell cycle arrest caused by various stresses. Interestingly, although cancer cells have the highest proliferative capacity within our body, they can also be driven into a senescent state by massive insults within the tumor microenvironment.

Non-proliferating cancer cells? You might find them a bit odd, and scientists initially thought the same. Consequently, they considered the possibility that these cancer cells might be a consequence of our body's defense mechanism against cancer progression; indeed, this is the case in the initial stages of carcinogenesis when oncogenes are highly overexpressed.

However, in 2017, our laboratory was the first to reveal that these senescent cancer cells actually possess cancer-promoting potency. In cases of papillary thyroid cancer, we found that senescent cancer cells are located at the invasive front of the cancer tissue and actually act as the spearhead of cancer invasion.

Moreover, senescent cancer cells are closely associated with the immune microenvironment of cancer. Cytotoxic T cells are one of the few cell types that have the potency to kill cancer cells. Indeed, senescent cancer cells express specific proteins that inhibit the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells into the cancer tissues. In other words, the presence of senescent cancer cells hinders and weakens the cancer-killing potency of our normal immune system.

Another notable feature is the uneven distribution of senescent cancer cells within cancer tissues. Interestingly, senescent cancer cells are located at the invasive front, while non-senescent, proliferating cancer cells are found near the relative center. In a subsequent study, we discovered that senescent tumor cells evolve from non-senescent tumor cells at the center. These senescent cancer cells, an evolved form of cancer cells, express various cancer-promoting factors, such as collagen and elastin-degrading molecules, and promote local invasion and metastasis.

Although various interesting studies have been performed on senescent cancer cells, many questions remain unanswered. How do senescent cancer cells evade immune attacks and survive? How are they associated with cancer cell survival after chemotherapy? How are senescent cancer cells related to the long-term relapse of cancer?
